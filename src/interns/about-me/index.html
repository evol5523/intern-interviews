      <p> Why I want to be a software engineer? Just because developing software is a funny thing. I like computer and machine since I was young, so I major electrical engineering when I studied in college. But gradually, I found software is more fun than hardware. Using different algorithm and method to make simple logical instructions become numerous functions and then combine them into a whole system. Like a Lego I played when I was a kid. Who doesn't like Lego?</p>
      <p> What I want to learn from this internship? First of all, for me, the largest disadvantage is lack of work experience. I didn't take an internship when I studied college since I was busy with school activity. This is the biggest mistake I have made. So I want to use this opportunity to acquire industry knowledge and understand what industry need nowadays. Secondly, since my college program is electrical engineering, I didn't have too much software project experience, even I acquired software knowledge while cooperating with companies over the course of my graduation project, compare to the computer science student, I do not have much software development experience. The most of my software experience is coming from the Leetcode, I finish about 250 questions so far. I would like to take this opportunity of internship to improve my skills and algorithm.   </p>
